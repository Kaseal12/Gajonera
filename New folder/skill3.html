       <h1>Cooking skill</h1>
        <p>I only learned this when I was allowed to use the stove, so this is my third skill. I learned to cook when there was no viand at home. Most of the dishes I make are improvised, but my parents have also taught me some recipes. When I cook rice, I make sure not to burn it.</p>
