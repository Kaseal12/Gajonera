       <h1>Computer skill</h1>
        <p>Ever since I was a child, I have loved computers. There were even times when I would spend my allowance on computer games. When the pandemic hit, I had to stop playing, and I felt sad in grade 9 because I didn’t get to experience assembling a computer since my ICT class was only online. Then came the day when I was allowed to go out again, and I was finally able to play. During that time, I also learned something important about computers because my uncle, who owns a computer shop, taught me. There was a time when I became the one to open the computer shop. In grade 11, we had a subject called Empowerment Technology, and I was really happy during that time because that’s when I gained some knowledge about HTML. Now, in college, I am happy because I got into the program I wanted, which is a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.</p>
