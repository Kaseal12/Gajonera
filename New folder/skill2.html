       <h1>Drawing skill</h1>
        <p>Since I was young, I have loved drawing. Whenever I didn’t have money and couldn’t ask my mom for some, I would just draw. However, I stopped doing it in high school. Of course, my drawing skills didn’t disappear; they would only come into play when I needed to draw for group projects. I graduated from Senior High School, and I started drawing portraits again. I mostly do freehand drawing, but when I get lazy, I use tracing. I started with graded pencils and kept buying supplies from Shopee. My drawing skills have been improving, and I feel happy when I can bring joy to others through my art.</p>
